# Landing Page

This is a basic landing page I created based on the landing page image provided by the Odin Project. It includes hero text, a random information section, a quote, and a sign-up section. For each section, I used HTML to create the basic elements and CSS to style the basic elements. I created headings and paragraphs with HTML. I used CSS to change colors, font properties, and other components. I used CSS flexbox to adjust the layout.

I also inserted images from Pexels. The rectangular image in the header belongs to Elisabeth Suske, who can be contacted at https://www.pexels.com/@elisabethsuske/. The square images in the random information section belong to Frank Cone, who can be contacted at https://www.pexels.com/@frank-cone-140140/.
